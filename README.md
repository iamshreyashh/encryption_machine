# ENCRYPTION_MACHINE 
* This project is a basic text encryption software developed using python. Here i use fernet(symmetric cryptographic algorithm) using cryptography algorithm. 
# How does it works?
 * It simply asks user to enter the file name and the user must take into account of saving that file into the folder itself in which the code is saved. otherwise errors might be encountered 
 * To encrypt just select the file from option 1 . Then select option 2. 
    * In this the software gives you the encrypted file content(non-readable form) and the corresponding key to it.  
 * using option 3 we can decrypt any encrypted file by entering the **Key** and **File name**.
   * Now you have the decrypted contents of the file. Greate now you can deploy this in your messanging application or securing a file.
